# Project Description
- In this project i regularized a model using L2 regularization with dropout while also comparing the perfomance improvements visually by plotting loss during training and validation.
- Due to reduced overfitting, the validation loss is decreased after using L2 regularization and dropout relative to the 
unregularized model.

- I also implemented custom callbacks for running code when certain events occur like begining of training, batches and epochs.
